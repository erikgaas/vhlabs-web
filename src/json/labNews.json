This fall they chose to shine the spotlight on the Visible Heart Lab. They were specifically interested in: the history of the lab where pioneering heart surgeries and transplant research were performed from the 1950s onward; our long standing research partnership with Medtronic; our unique ability to routinely reanimate large mammalian hearts with a clear perfusate (including 73 human hearts deemed not viable for transplant); the number (hundreds) and diversity of scientists, research collaborators, clinicians, and students that visit or work in our lab annually; the free-access Atlas of Human Cardiac Anatomy which serves as an educational resource for clinicians, engineers, patients and students of all levels (>5,000 downloadable images and movies plus tutorials); our human heart library that currently contains 400+ human heart specimens available for study; our ability to train new generations of engineers that become leaders in the medical device industry; our various outreach educational opportunities that teach cardiac anatomy, physiology and devices to people of all ages; our cardiac modeling and 3D printing capabilities.",
