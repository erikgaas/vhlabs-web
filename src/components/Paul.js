					<h4>Personal Teaching and Mentoring Philosophy</h4>	
					<p>I consider learning to be a highly individualized process for which my role as a teacher is to assist individuals to identify the modes of learning which work best for them. In fact, my advice to teaching assistants with whom I have worked is to be as creative in their teaching style as possible. By striving to find new creative angles to present information, a natural result is enhanced learning and perceived excitement for the topic. I personally have enjoyed the advances in computer technology that have allowed for dynamic Powerpoint presentations into which I can easily incorporate video clips.
					</p>
					<p>It has been my good fortune to witness nearly 70 graduate students complete their degrees while working in my laboratory. Currently, there are 7 doctoral students and 3 masters students working on their research projects in my lab. Yes, it does take much time and effort to train such a group of students, but the mentoring adventure is what, in part, motivates me to continue searching for funding for my research. Additionally, I have been fortunate to have high degrees of camaraderie amongst the students in my lab, hence they play a large role in training each other. More importantly, the way I look at it, I have come to make many good friends while students have worked with me on my research interests.
